'''Generic is the method that actually performs simplex
projection. It does so for one point only. All other methods are
wrappers around this method --- they manage generating block structure
etc.

We ***always*** assume there is no "time" column - if there are time
stamps, these are always assumed to be in the index of the
dataframe. If there is a time/data/whatever column (that is not the
index) - you can expect weird behaviour.
